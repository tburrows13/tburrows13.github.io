## Trumpet

I've been playing both classical and jazz trumpet for many years. Some of the groups I've played with include:

* Selwyn College Big Band
* Christ's Jazz
* Junior RNCM Big Band (Lead Trumpet)
* Junior RNCM Brass Band (Principal Cornet)
* Youth Orbit
* Muskrat Ramble Jazz Quintet
* Haffner Orchestra

You can hear Youth Orbit's most recent project Planetarium [on streaming platforms](https://li.sten.to/youthorbit) or directly here:

For more traditional jazz, I've also been on the Muskrat Ramble album Auditorium:
