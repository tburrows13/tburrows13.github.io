## Trumpet

I've been playing both jazz and classical trumpet for many years. Some of the groups I've played with include:
* Cambridge University Jazz Orchestra
* Christ's Jazz
* Junior RNCM Big Band (Lead Trumpet)
* Junior RNCM Brass Band (Principal Cornet)
* Youth Orbit
* Muskrat Ramble Jazz Quintet
* National Youth Jazz Collective
* Haffner Orchestra

You can hear Youth Orbit's most recent project Planetarium [on streaming platforms](https://li.sten.to/youthorbit) or directly here:

## Organ

I was an Organ Scholar at Christ's College Cambridge. If you would like me to play for a service, please get in touch by email.

In March 2022, I recorded the album [Like to a flower](https://smarturl.it/FREVU0) with the Christ's choir, both singing and playing organ.
