* Christ's Jazz
* Junior RNCM Big Band (Lead Trumpet)
* Junior RNCM Brass Band (Principal Cornet)
* Youth Orbit
* Muskrat Ramble Jazz Quintet
* National Youth Jazz Collective
* Haffner Orchestra

## Organ

I am an Organ Scholar at Christ's College Cambridge.  If you require me to play for a service, the best way to get in contact is by email.
